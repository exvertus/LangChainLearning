He is willing to do whatever it takes to help the team, from feature engineering/experiment running, to tricky backend tasks that he had no idea how to do and figured out. For example, he figured out how to cut down the memory overhead of our multiprocessing workloads by 5x just by reading about how multiprocessing works and profiling the code, most data scientists I have worked with do not go that deep into \"backend\" programming. \n\nHe is also very strong at prioritizing next steps and isolating bottlenecks. For example, he identified a moment when a model was good enough to put in front of users (I wanted to keep making it better) and reoriented me towards doing the data engineering necessary to get the model out the door.  His next step intuition is so good that even when I was meant to be managing him I would send him my plan for every day to get his feedback, and this ended up saving me a huge amount of time. Harrison is a very strong python programmer and a careful code reviewer \u2014 he will take the bugs that nobody wants to fix, even if he didn\u2019t create them, or provide a useful solution concept to a less experienced programmer if he thinks they would benefit from implementing it themselves.\n\nFinally, Harrison has an uncanny ability to generate significant model improvements by looking model at errors and thinking of features that might explain those differences. This skill is not only relevant with Timeseries and text data, which we worked on at Kensho \u2014 we did a sports project together and it was exactly the same. In conclusion, Harrison knows exactly what features need to be built and consistently gets to a point where the model is good enough to productionize, and also has the skills to productionize and get feedback from users."], "activities": [], "similarly_named_profiles": [], "articles": [], "groups": [{"profile_pic_url":

He is willing to do whatever it takes to help the team, from feature engineering/experiment running, to tricky backend tasks that he had no idea how to do and figured out. For example, he figured out how to cut down the memory overhead of our multiprocessing workloads by 5x just by reading about how multiprocessing works and profiling the code, most data scientists I have worked with do not go that deep into \"backend\" programming. \n\nHe is also very strong at prioritizing next steps and isolating bottlenecks. For example, he identified a moment when a model was good enough to put in front of users (I wanted to keep making it better) and reoriented me towards doing the data engineering necessary to get the model out the door.  His next step intuition is so good that even when I was meant to be managing him I would send him my plan for every day to get his feedback, and this ended up saving me a huge amount of time. Harrison is a very strong python programmer and a careful code reviewer \u2014 he will take the bugs that nobody wants to fix, even if he didn\u2019t create them, or provide a useful solution concept to a less experienced programmer if he thinks they would benefit from implementing it themselves.\n\nFinally, Harrison has an uncanny ability to generate significant model improvements by looking model at errors and thinking of features that might explain those differences. This skill is not only relevant with Timeseries and text data, which we worked on at Kensho \u2014 we did a sports project together and it was exactly the same. In conclusion, Harrison knows exactly what features need to be built and consistently gets to a point where the model is good enough to productionize, and also has the skills to productionize and get feedback from users."], "activities": [], "similarly_named_profiles": [], "articles": [], "groups": [{"profile_pic_url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5607AQG-nbIUJbOhRg/group-logo_image-shrink_48x48/0/1630999209236?e=1704283200&v=beta&t=SKUDV5nDqVEXpxZYLUKkOF733qiUxJPh5NazquJ8Xy0", "name": "Harvard Engineering and Applied Sciences Alumni", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13881335"}, {"profile_pic_url": "https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5607AQH6AydVJ99PdQ/group-logo_image-shrink_48x48/0/1631419369862?e=1704283200&v=beta&t=DmStTAstQ2U-mR7VU_I7WKFD6Ja4z6vHM5uzrwPXSsc", "name": "HSAC Members & Alumni", "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13504297"}], "skills": [], "inferred_salary": null, "gender": null, "birth_date": null, "industry": null, "extra": null, "interests": [], "personal_emails": [], "personal_numbers": []}}
